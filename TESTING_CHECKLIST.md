# ✅ POST-DEPLOYMENT TESTING CHECKLIST

## 🔄 Deployment Status

**Check Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard

Wait for deployment to show **"Ready"** (usually 2-3 minutes)

---

## 🧪 TEST 1: Admin Login Works

1. **Visit**: https://mintedmerch.vercel.app/admin
2. **Enter**: Your ADMIN_PASSWORD
3. **Click**: "Login"
4. **Expected**: Dashboard loads with data (orders, stats, leaderboard)
5. **Check DevTools**: 
   - Press F12
   - Go to Application → Local Storage
   - Should see `admin_token` stored

**✅ PASS if**: Dashboard loads with data  
**❌ FAIL if**: Error message or stays on login screen

---

## 🧪 TEST 2: Endpoints Are Protected

Open terminal and run these:

```bash
# Test admin endpoint without auth (should FAIL)
curl https://mintedmerch.vercel.app/api/admin/orders

# Expected response:
# {"success":false,"error":"Authentication required","message":"No authentication token provided"}
```

```bash
# Test debug endpoint without auth (should FAIL)
curl https://mintedmerch.vercel.app/api/debug/cleanup-spin

# Expected response:
# {"success":false,"error":"Authentication required","message":"No authentication token provided"}
```

**✅ PASS if**: Both return 401 errors about authentication  
**❌ FAIL if**: Either returns actual data

---

## 🧪 TEST 3: Wrong Password Fails

1. **Visit**: https://mintedmerch.vercel.app/admin
2. **Enter**: Wrong password (e.g., "wrongpassword123")
3. **Click**: "Login"
4. **Expected**: Error message "Invalid password"

**✅ PASS if**: Shows error and doesn't login  
**❌ FAIL if**: Logs in anyway

---

## 🧪 TEST 4: Logout Works

1. **After logging in successfully**
2. **Find logout button** in admin dashboard
3. **Click logout**
4. **Expected**: Redirected to login screen
5. **Check DevTools**: `admin_token` should be removed from localStorage

**✅ PASS if**: Logged out and token cleared  
**❌ FAIL if**: Still shows dashboard

---

## 🧪 TEST 5: Create Discount Code (Admin Function)

1. **Login to admin dashboard**
2. **Go to "Discounts" tab**
3. **Click "Create New Discount"**
4. **Fill in**:
   - Code: TEST2025
   - Type: Percentage
   - Value: 10
   - Scope: Site-wide
5. **Click Create**
6. **Expected**: Discount appears in list

**✅ PASS if**: Discount created successfully  
**❌ FAIL if**: Error or nothing happens

---

## 🧪 TEST 6: Token Expiration (Optional Long Test)

1. **Login to admin dashboard**
2. **Wait 8+ hours** (or change JWT expiration to 1 minute for testing)
3. **Try to use dashboard**
4. **Expected**: Automatically logged out and redirected to login

**✅ PASS if**: Auto-logged out after expiration  
**❌ FAIL if**: Still works after token expires

---

## 🚨 IF ANY TEST FAILS

### Test 1 Fails (Can't Login):

**Check**:
1. JWT_SECRET is in Vercel environment variables
2. ADMIN_PASSWORD is in Vercel environment variables
3. Both have "Production" environment selected
4. Deployment finished successfully (no build errors)

**Fix**:
- Go to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables
- Verify both secrets are there
- Click "Redeploy" if needed

### Test 2 Fails (Endpoints Not Protected):

**This means authentication didn't deploy correctly**

**Check**:
1. Go to GitHub and verify commit went through
2. Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
3. Verify files were actually modified in GitHub repo

**Fix**:
- May need to manually redeploy in Vercel
- Check for build errors in logs

### Test 3 Fails (Wrong Password Logs In):

**CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE**

**This should never happen** - contact immediately if this occurs

### General Troubleshooting:

```bash
# Clear browser cache
# Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
# Clear "Cached images and files" and "Cookies"

# Or try incognito/private browsing
# Ctrl+Shift+N (Chrome) or Cmd+Shift+N (Safari)
```

## ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED?

**Congratulations!** Your admin dashboard and debug endpoints are now secured with JWT authentication.

### What You've Accomplished:

- ✅ Fixed critical security vulnerability
- ✅ Protected 25 admin endpoints
- ✅ Protected 92 debug endpoints  
- ✅ Implemented JWT token authentication
- ✅ Added 8-hour token expiration
- ✅ Added auto-logout on invalid tokens
- ✅ Prevented unauthorized discount creation
- ✅ Prevented unauthorized customer data access

### Security Status: 🟢 SECURE

---

## 📊 MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Daily:
- Check Vercel logs for suspicious failed login attempts
- Review any unusual admin activity

### Weekly:
- Review list of active discount codes
- Check for any anomalies in orders

### Monthly:
- Rotate JWT_SECRET (generates new secret, invalidates all tokens)
- Update ADMIN_PASSWORD
- Review admin access logs

### Quarterly:
- Full security audit
- Update all dependencies (`npm update`)
- Review and remove unused debug endpoints

---

## 🔐 SECURITY BEST PRACTICES

**DO**:
- ✅ Keep JWT_SECRET and ADMIN_PASSWORD secret
- ✅ Use strong passwords (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- ✅ Enable 2FA on your Vercel account
- ✅ Enable 2FA on your GitHub account
- ✅ Rotate secrets every 90 days
- ✅ Review admin logs regularly
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Share JWT_SECRET with anyone
- ❌ Share ADMIN_PASSWORD with untrusted users
- ❌ Commit secrets to GitHub
- ❌ Use the same password for multiple services
- ❌ Disable authentication "temporarily"
- ❌ Grant admin access without verification

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS (OPTIONAL)

Consider implementing:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Limit failed login attempts
2. **2FA**: Add two-factor authentication to admin
3. **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict admin access to trusted IPs
4. **Audit Logging**: Log all admin actions to database
5. **Session Management**: Track and revoke active sessions
6. **Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels
