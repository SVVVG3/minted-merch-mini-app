# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY INCIDENT REPORT

**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: RESOLVED  

## Summary

A critical security vulnerability was discovered where the Supabase `anon` role had full table-level permissions on ALL database tables, completely bypassing Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## Vulnerability Details

### Issue 1: Table-Level Permission Bypass
- **Problem**: `anon` role had SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE permissions on all tables
- **Impact**: Users could query ANY table directly, bypassing RLS policies
- **Risk**: Complete database exposure, access to sensitive partner data, user PII, etc.

### Issue 2: Discount Manipulation  
- **Problem**: Client-side discount amounts trusted without server validation
- **Impact**: Users could achieve 100% discounts by manipulating client requests
- **Risk**: Financial loss, fraudulent orders

### Issue 3: Database Schema Exposure
- **Problem**: Anon users could query information_schema and pg_catalog
- **Impact**: Complete database structure visible to attackers
- **Risk**: Reconnaissance for further attacks

## Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. Emergency Database Security Fix (Applied: Oct 2, 2025)
```sql
-- Revoked ALL permissions from anon on ALL tables
REVOKE ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM anon;

-- Granted back ONLY minimal required permissions:
-- Products: SELECT only (catalog)
-- Profiles: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE (RLS controlled)
-- Orders: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE (RLS controlled) 
-- Discount codes: SELECT only (RLS controlled)
-- Gift cards: SELECT only (RLS controlled)
-- Leaderboard: Controlled access for gamification

-- BLOCKED access to sensitive tables:
-- - partners (sensitive partner data)
-- - chat_members (private chat data)
-- - chat_invitations (private invitations)
-- - security_audit_log (security logs)
```

### 2. Server-Side Discount Validation (Deployed)
- Added server-side discount validation in order creation API
- Reject orders where client discount doesn't match server calculation
- Log all manipulation attempts for monitoring

### 3. Enhanced RLS Policies (Applied)
- Restricted partners table access to service role only
- Secured chat tables to authenticated users only
- Limited point transactions to user's own data
- Added comprehensive security audit logging

### 4. Schema Access Restriction (Applied)
- Revoked anon access to information_schema and pg_catalog
- Created limited public_table_info view for necessary metadata
- Blocked direct schema enumeration

## Verification

### Before Fix:
```
Table: partners - PUBLIC ACCESS ‚ùå
Table: chat_members - PUBLIC ACCESS ‚ùå  
Table: orders - PUBLIC ACCESS ‚ùå
Table: profiles - PUBLIC ACCESS ‚ùå
[All tables publicly accessible]
```

### After Fix:
```
Table: partners - NO ANON ACCESS ‚úÖ
Table: chat_members - NO ANON ACCESS ‚úÖ
Table: chat_invitations - NO ANON ACCESS ‚úÖ
Table: security_audit_log - NO ANON ACCESS ‚úÖ
[Only minimal required permissions granted]
```

## Security Monitoring Added

1. **Security Audit Log**: All suspicious activities logged to `security_audit_log` table
2. **Admin Monitoring**: `/api/admin/security-audit` endpoint for real-time monitoring
3. **Automated Alerts**: Server logs flag manipulation attempts
4. **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Pattern recognition for repeated attacks

## Lessons Learned

1. **Default Permissions**: Supabase grants broad default permissions to `anon` role
2. **RLS Limitations**: RLS only controls row access, not table access
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers needed (table permissions + RLS + server validation)
4. **Regular Audits**: Security permissions need regular review

## Ongoing Security Measures

1. **Monthly Security Audits**: Review all table permissions and RLS policies
2. **Penetration Testing**: Regular security testing by external researchers
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time security event monitoring
4. **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for future security issues

## Impact Assessment

- **Data Breach**: None confirmed (vulnerability discovered before exploitation)
- **Financial Impact**: Minimal (discount manipulation caught early)
- **User Trust**: Maintained through proactive security response
- **Compliance**: Security measures now exceed industry standards

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the security researcher who responsibly disclosed these vulnerabilities, enabling us to fix them before any significant exploitation occurred.
