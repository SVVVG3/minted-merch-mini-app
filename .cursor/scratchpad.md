# Farcaster Shopify Mini App - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Building a Farcaster Mini App for https://mintedmerch.shop/ that allows users to shop directly inside Farcaster and pay using USDC via direct onchain wallet transfers. Using https://github.com/jc4p/shopify-mini-app-frame as the base template.

**Goal**: Complete MVP that enables:
- Product browsing inside Farcaster ‚úÖ
- Cart functionality ‚úÖ
- USDC payment flow ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **CURRENT FOCUS**
- Shopify order creation

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Environment Setup**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Shopify API credentials configured and working
- **Farcaster Integration**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Mini App context and authentication working
- **Payment Flow**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - USDC payments on Base using Farcaster wallet integration working
- **E-Commerce Checkout**: üéØ **CURRENT** - Build proper shipping/tax calculation before payment
- **Order Management**: Automated Shopify order creation after payment confirmation

### Phase 6 Technical Analysis - E-Commerce Checkout Flow

**Key Requirements for Proper E-Commerce:**

1. **Shipping Address Collection**
   - Standard address form (name, address, city, state, zip, country)
   - Address validation and formatting
   - Integration with Farcaster user context (pre-fill name if available)

2. **Shopify Checkout API Integration**
   - Use checkoutCreate mutation to create temporary checkout
   - Send cart line items + shipping address
   - Receive available shipping methods and rates
   - Get calculated taxes based on shipping location
   - Return final pricing breakdown

3. **Payment Flow Updates**
   - Display itemized checkout summary (subtotal, shipping, taxes, total)
   - Update USDC payment amount to include all fees
   - Ensure payment amount matches Shopify checkout total

4. **Order Creation Workflow**
   - After successful USDC payment, create actual Shopify order
   - Use Admin API to create order with payment marked as paid
   - Include all customer details, shipping info, and line items
   - Generate order confirmation and tracking

**Technical Approach:**
- **Storefront API**: For checkout creation and shipping/tax calculation
- **Admin API**: For final order creation after payment
- **State Management**: Extend cart context to include shipping/checkout data
- **UI/UX**: Multi-step checkout flow (cart ‚Üí shipping ‚Üí payment ‚Üí confirmation)

### Phase 5 Technical Analysis - USDC Payment Integration

**Key Insights from Farcaster Wallet Documentation:**
- Farcaster Mini Apps have built-in wallet integration via `sdk.wallet.getEthereumProvider()`
- No need for "select your wallet" dialogs - Farcaster client handles wallet connection
- Recommended to use Wagmi for type-safe wallet interactions
- Base network is supported and recommended for USDC transactions
- Users can be automatically connected if they have a wallet, otherwise prompt to connect

**Payment Flow Architecture:**
1. **Wallet Connection**: Use `@farcaster/frame-wagmi-connector` with Wagmi
2. **USDC Contract Integration**: Interact with USDC on Base network
3. **Transaction Flow**: Direct wallet ‚Üí merchant wallet transfer
4. **Order Creation**: Create Shopify order after payment confirmation

**Technical Requirements:**
- Install Wagmi and Farcaster connector
- Configure Base network connection
- Set up USDC contract interaction
- Build payment confirmation UI
- Integrate with existing cart functionality

**Next: Task 16** - Integrate Shopify checkout API for shipping & tax calculation

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS - Missing E-Commerce Components:**

Currently our app has a fundamental gap: we collect payment but don't have proper e-commerce checkout flow. Real online stores need:

1. **Shipping Address Collection** - Users must provide delivery address
2. **Shipping Cost Calculation** - Different shipping rates based on location/method
3. **Tax Calculation** - Sales tax based on shipping address
4. **Final Total Calculation** - Products + Shipping + Taxes = Final Amount
5. **Order Creation** - Create actual Shopify order with all details

**Current Payment Flow Problem:**
- User pays cart total (products only)
- No shipping address collected
- No shipping costs calculated
- No taxes calculated
- No Shopify order created
- Merchant has payment but no order details

**Revised Phase 6 Strategy:**

**Task 15: Build shipping address collection form**
- Create ShippingForm component with address fields
- Integrate with existing checkout flow before payment
- Add address validation and formatting
- Store shipping address in checkout state

**Task 16: Integrate Shopify checkout API for shipping & tax calculation**
- Use Shopify Storefront API checkoutCreate mutation
- Send cart items + shipping address to get shipping rates
- Calculate taxes based on shipping address
- Return final totals (subtotal + shipping + taxes)

**Task 17: Update payment flow with final totals**
- Modify CheckoutFlow to show itemized breakdown
- Display: Subtotal, Shipping, Taxes, Final Total
- Update USDC payment amount to final total
- Ensure user pays correct amount including all fees

**Task 18: Build Shopify Admin API client for order creation**
- Set up Admin API credentials (different from Storefront API)
- Create order creation functions
- Handle order status and tracking

**Task 19: Build API route to create Shopify orders**
- Create /api/shopify/orders endpoint
- Accept payment confirmation + order details
- Create order in Shopify with all customer/shipping info
- Return order confirmation details

**Task 20: Connect payment confirmation to order creation**
- After successful USDC payment, automatically create Shopify order
- Pass all checkout data (items, shipping, customer info)
- Display order confirmation with order number
- Send order details to customer (if email provided)

**Success Criteria for Phase 6:**

**Task 15 Success Criteria:**

   - USDC transfer functionality using useWriteContract
   - Transaction confirmation waiting with useWaitForTransactionReceipt
   - Comprehensive error handling and status tracking
   - Balance validation before payment execution

3. **Complete Payment Flow UI**:

- ‚úÖ Transaction approval flow with proper UI feedback
- ‚úÖ Payment success handling and cart clearing
- ‚úÖ Error handling for insufficient balance and failed transactions
- ‚úÖ Ready for testing in Farcaster Mini App environment

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses 1:1 USD to USDC conversion (MVP approach)
- Transfers directly to merchant wallet: `0xEDb90eF78C78681eE504b9E00950d84443a3E86B`
- USDC contract on Base: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`
- Proper 6-decimal USDC amount handling
- Transaction confirmation with blockchain verification

**Ready for Testing:**
The USDC payment flow is now complete and ready for testing! Users can:
1. Add items to cart
2. Click "Pay X.XX USDC" button
3. See their wallet balance and payment summary
4. Execute USDC transfer to merchant wallet
5. Get real-time transaction status updates
6. Receive confirmation when payment succeeds

**Next Phase**: We're essentially ready for Phase 6 (Shopify Order Creation) since the payment flow is complete. Task 15 was completed as part of Task 14, and most of Task 16 is also done.

**Please test the USDC payment functionality and let me know how it works!**

## Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- `window.confirm()` and `alert()` don't work reliably in Farcaster Mini App environments - use custom React modals instead
- Clear Cart functionality required custom confirmation modal to work in production Mini App context
- localStorage operations should have error handling for restricted embedded environments

## Next Steps

1. User should test localhost:3000 to confirm setup
2. Commit Task 1 completion to GitHub  
3. Proceed to Task 2: Setup Vercel project
