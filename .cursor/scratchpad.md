# Farcaster Shopify Mini App - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Building a Farcaster Mini App for https://mintedmerch.shop/ that allows users to shop directly inside Farcaster and pay using USDC via direct onchain wallet transfers. Using https://github.com/jc4p/shopify-mini-app-frame as the base template.

**Goal**: Complete MVP that enables:
- Product browsing inside Farcaster ‚úÖ
- Cart functionality ‚úÖ
- USDC payment flow ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **CURRENT FOCUS**
- Shopify order creation

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Environment Setup**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Shopify API credentials configured and working
- **Farcaster Integration**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Mini App context and authentication working
- **Payment Flow**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - USDC payments on Base using Farcaster wallet integration working
- **E-Commerce Checkout**: üéØ **CURRENT** - Build proper shipping/tax calculation before payment
- **Order Management**: Automated Shopify order creation after payment confirmation

### Phase 6 Technical Analysis - E-Commerce Checkout Flow

**Key Requirements for Proper E-Commerce:**

1. **Shipping Address Collection**
   - Standard address form (name, address, city, state, zip, country)
   - Address validation and formatting
   - Integration with Farcaster user context (pre-fill name if available)

2. **Shopify Checkout API Integration**
   - Use checkoutCreate mutation to create temporary checkout
   - Send cart line items + shipping address
   - Receive available shipping methods and rates
   - Get calculated taxes based on shipping location
   - Return final pricing breakdown

3. **Payment Flow Updates**
   - Display itemized checkout summary (subtotal, shipping, taxes, total)
   - Update USDC payment amount to include all fees
   - Ensure payment amount matches Shopify checkout total

4. **Order Creation Workflow**
   - After successful USDC payment, create actual Shopify order
   - Use Admin API to create order with payment marked as paid
   - Include all customer details, shipping info, and line items
   - Generate order confirmation and tracking

**Technical Approach:**
- **Storefront API**: For checkout creation and shipping/tax calculation
- **Admin API**: For final order creation after payment
- **State Management**: Extend cart context to include shipping/checkout data
- **UI/UX**: Multi-step checkout flow (cart ‚Üí shipping ‚Üí payment ‚Üí confirmation)

### Phase 5 Technical Analysis - USDC Payment Integration

**Key Insights from Farcaster Wallet Documentation:**
- Farcaster Mini Apps have built-in wallet integration via `sdk.wallet.getEthereumProvider()`
- No need for "select your wallet" dialogs - Farcaster client handles wallet connection
- Recommended to use Wagmi for type-safe wallet interactions
- Base network is supported and recommended for USDC transactions
- Users can be automatically connected if they have a wallet, otherwise prompt to connect

**Payment Flow Architecture:**
1. **Wallet Connection**: Use `@farcaster/frame-wagmi-connector` with Wagmi
2. **USDC Contract Integration**: Interact with USDC on Base network
3. **Transaction Flow**: Direct wallet ‚Üí merchant wallet transfer
4. **Order Creation**: Create Shopify order after payment confirmation

**Technical Requirements:**
- Install Wagmi and Farcaster connector
- Configure Base network connection
- Set up USDC contract interaction
- Build payment confirmation UI
- Integrate with existing cart functionality

**Next: Ready for Phase 7 - Final MVP Testing and Production Deployment**

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS - Missing E-Commerce Components:**

Currently our app has a fundamental gap: we collect payment but don't have proper e-commerce checkout flow. Real online stores need:

1. **Shipping Address Collection** - Users must provide delivery address
2. **Shipping Cost Calculation** - Different shipping rates based on location/method
3. **Tax Calculation** - Sales tax based on shipping address
4. **Final Total Calculation** - Products + Shipping + Taxes = Final Amount
5. **Order Creation** - Create actual Shopify order with all details

**Current Payment Flow Problem:**
- User pays cart total (products only)
- No shipping address collected
- No shipping costs calculated
- No taxes calculated
- No Shopify order created
- Merchant has payment but no order details

**Revised Phase 6 Strategy:**

**Task 15: Build shipping address collection form**
- Create ShippingForm component with address fields
- Integrate with existing checkout flow before payment
- Add address validation and formatting
- Store shipping address in checkout state

**Task 16: Integrate Shopify checkout API for shipping & tax calculation**
- Use Shopify Storefront API checkoutCreate mutation
- Send cart items + shipping address to get shipping rates
- Calculate taxes based on shipping address
- Return final totals (subtotal + shipping + taxes)

**Task 17: Update payment flow with final totals**
- Modify CheckoutFlow to show itemized breakdown
- Display: Subtotal, Shipping, Taxes, Final Total
- Update USDC payment amount to final total
- Ensure user pays correct amount including all fees

**Task 18: Build Shopify Admin API client for order creation**
- Set up Admin API credentials (different from Storefront API)
- Create order creation functions
- Handle order status and tracking

**Task 19: Build API route to create Shopify orders**
- Create /api/shopify/orders endpoint
- Accept payment confirmation + order details
- Create order in Shopify with all customer/shipping info
- Return order confirmation details

**Task 20: Connect payment confirmation to order creation**
- After successful USDC payment, automatically create Shopify order
- Pass all checkout data (items, shipping, customer info)
- Display order confirmation with order number
- Send order details to customer (if email provided)

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**üîß Order Creation Issue Diagnosed and Fixed!**

**Problem Identified:**
The payment was successful, but Shopify order creation was failing with 500 Internal Server Error because:
1. **Domain Mismatch**: Admin API was hardcoded to use `frensdaily-shop.myshopify.com` instead of using the environment variable `shopfrensdaily.myshopify.com`
2. **Inconsistent Configuration**: Multiple API endpoints had hardcoded domains instead of using environment variables

**Fixes Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ **Fixed Shopify Admin API Configuration** (`src/lib/shopifyAdmin.js`):
   - Changed hardcoded domain to use `process.env.SHOPIFY_SITE_DOMAIN`
   - Added proper environment variable validation
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

2. ‚úÖ **Fixed Checkout API Configuration** (`src/app/api/shopify/checkout/route.js`):
   - Changed hardcoded domain to use environment variable consistently
   - Ensures all Shopify API calls use the same domain

3. ‚úÖ **Environment Validation**:
   - Confirmed all required environment variables are present in production
   - `SHOPIFY_SITE_DOMAIN`: ‚úÖ `shopfrensdaily`
   - `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`: ‚úÖ 32 characters (Storefront API)
   - `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`: ‚úÖ 38 characters (Admin API)

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Domain Configuration Fixed**: All API endpoints now use correct domain
- ‚úÖ **Environment Variables Validated**: All required tokens present in production
- ‚úÖ **Code Deployed**: Changes pushed to production and deployed
- üîÑ **Ready for Testing**: Order creation should now work properly

**Next Steps:**
1. **User should test the complete flow again**:
   - Add products to cart
   - Go through checkout (address ‚Üí shipping ‚Üí payment)
   - Complete USDC payment
   - Verify order creation succeeds and shows order confirmation

2. **Expected Result**: After successful payment, user should see:
   - Order confirmation screen with order number
   - Order details (items, shipping, total)
   - Cart automatically cleared
   - No more "Internal server error"

**If the issue persists**, we may need to check Shopify Admin API permissions or investigate other potential API issues, but the domain mismatch was the most likely cause of the 500 error.

## Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- `window.confirm()` and `alert()` don't work reliably in Farcaster Mini App environments - use custom React modals instead
- Clear Cart functionality required custom confirmation modal to work in production Mini App context
- localStorage operations should have error handling for restricted embedded environments

## Current Status: Task 17 - Update payment flow with final totals (products + shipping + taxes)

**COMPLETED** ‚úÖ - Payment flow successfully updated with shipping selection and accurate final totals.

### Implementation Summary:
1. ‚úÖ Added `selectedShipping` field to CartContext state management

4. ‚úÖ Updated payment calculations to include selected shipping cost
5. ‚úÖ Fixed final total calculation: Subtotal + Tax + Selected Shipping
6. ‚úÖ Updated payment button and balance checks with correct amounts

### Key Features Implemented:
- **3-Step Checkout Flow**: 
  - Step 1: Shipping Address Collection
  - Step 2: Shipping Method Selection (NEW)
  - Step 3: Payment with Final Totals
- **Shipping Method Selection**: Interactive radio button interface for choosing shipping options
- **Accurate Total Calculation**: Final Total = Subtotal + Tax + Selected Shipping Cost
- **Payment Integration**: USDC payment uses correct final amount including all fees
- **State Management**: Selected shipping method persisted in CartContext
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Step indicators, back navigation, clear pricing breakdown

### Checkout Flow Structure:
```
1. Shipping Address ‚Üí "Continue to Shipping Options"
2. Shipping Method Selection ‚Üí "Continue to Payment" 
3. Payment ‚Üí "Pay [Final Total] USDC"
```

### Final Total Calculation:
```javascript
const finalTotal = cart.checkout.subtotal.amount + 
                   cart.checkout.tax.amount + 
                   cart.selectedShipping.price.amount;
