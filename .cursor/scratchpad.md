# Farcaster Shopify Mini App - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Building a Farcaster Mini App for https://mintedmerch.shop/ that allows users to shop directly inside Farcaster and pay using USDC via direct onchain wallet transfers. Using https://github.com/jc4p/shopify-mini-app-frame as the base template.

**Goal**: Complete MVP that enables:
- Product browsing inside Farcaster ✅
- Cart functionality ✅
- USDC payment flow ✅ **WORKING**
- Shopify order creation ✅ **WORKING**
- Enhanced UX features ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Environment Setup**: ✅ COMPLETED - Shopify API credentials configured and working
- **Farcaster Integration**: ✅ COMPLETED - Mini App context and authentication working
- **Payment Flow**: ✅ COMPLETED - USDC payments execute successfully and cart clears
- **E-Commerce Checkout**: ✅ COMPLETED - 3-step checkout with shipping/tax calculation working
- **Order Management**: ✅ COMPLETED - Orders are being created successfully in Shopify
- **Google Maps Migration**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Migrated to new PlaceAutocompleteElement API
- **UX Improvements**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Fixed Google Maps clearing user data and "(Default Title)" display issues

### Recent UX Fixes

**Issue 1: Google Maps Clearing First/Last Name** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Root Cause**: When Google Maps autocomplete selected a place, the `populateAddressFromPlace` function was creating a completely new shipping object, overwriting firstName and lastName fields
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - ✅ **Preserve User Data**: Modified `populateAddressFromPlace` to preserve existing firstName, lastName, phone, and email when updating address
  - ✅ **Smart Address Update**: Only update address-related fields (address1, city, province, zip, country) from Google Maps
  - ✅ **Clear Address2**: Reset address2 field when using autocomplete for cleaner addresses
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Users can now fill in their name first, then use address autocomplete without losing their personal information

**Issue 2: "(Default Title)" Display in Product Names** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Root Cause**: Cart items store both product title and variant title, and when variant title was "Default Title", it was being displayed as "Product Name (Default Title)"
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - ✅ **Order History**: Updated OrderHistory component to only show variant title if it's not "Default Title"
  - ✅ **Checkout Flow**: Updated all three instances in CheckoutFlow component (shipping, shipping-method, and payment steps) to hide "Default Title" variants
  - ✅ **Consistent Logic**: Applied consistent filtering logic: `item.variant?.title && item.variant.title !== 'Default Title' && \`(${item.variant.title})\``
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Product names now display cleanly without unnecessary "(Default Title)" text

### Recent API Migration

**Issue: Google Places API Deprecation Warning** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Root Cause**: Google deprecated `google.maps.places.Autocomplete` as of March 1st, 2025
- **Warning Message**: "As of March 1st, 2025, google.maps.places.Autocomplete is not available to new customers. Please use google.maps.places.PlaceAutocompleteElement instead."
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - ✅ **Complete Migration**: Updated from deprecated `Autocomplete` to new `PlaceAutocompleteElement`
  - ✅ **API Import**: Changed to use `await google.maps.importLibrary('places')` for dynamic loading
  - ✅ **Event Handling**: Updated from `place_changed` event to `gmp-select` event listener
  - ✅ **Place Object**: Updated to use `event.placePrediction.toPlace()` and `place.fetchFields()`
  - ✅ **Address Components**: Updated field names from `long_name/short_name` to `longText/shortText`
  - ✅ **Country Restrictions**: Changed from `setComponentRestrictions()` to `includedRegionCodes` property
  - ✅ **UI Integration**: Replaced input element binding with container-based embedding
  - ✅ **CSS Styling**: Added CSS custom properties for styling the new element
  - ✅ **Fallback Support**: Maintained fallback input when Google Maps API is not available
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - No more deprecation warnings, future-proofed implementation

## Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- `window.confirm()` and `alert()` don't work reliably in Farcaster Mini App environments - use custom React modals instead
- Clear Cart functionality required custom confirmation modal to work in production Mini App context
- localStorage operations should have error handling for restricted embedded environments
- **Wagmi Connector Issues**: The `"getChainId is not a function"` error is a known Wagmi timing issue that requires waiting for connections to be ready before executing transactions
- **CRITICAL: Wagmi Hook Properties**: ⚠️ **NEVER use spread operator with USDC_CONTRACT in Wagmi hooks!** Both `useReadContract` and `writeContract` MUST use explicit `address: USDC_CONTRACT.address, abi: USDC_CONTRACT.abi` properties. Using `...USDC_CONTRACT` causes connector initialization errors.
- **Shopify API Debugging**: Enhanced logging is crucial for diagnosing order creation issues - always log request variables and response data
- **API Version Consistency**: Keep all Shopify API endpoints on the same version to avoid compatibility issues
- **Google Maps API Migration**: Google is actively deprecating older APIs. The `google.maps.places.Autocomplete` was deprecated March 1st, 2025. Always migrate to newer APIs (`PlaceAutocompleteElement`) to avoid console warnings and ensure continued functionality. The new API uses different event names (`gmp-select` vs `place_changed`), data structures (`longText/shortText` vs `long_name/short_name`), and integration methods (container-based vs input-based).
- **Google Maps Form Preservation**: When implementing address autocomplete, always preserve existing user input (firstName, lastName, phone, email) by using spread operator with existing state rather than creating a completely new object. Only update address-related fields from the autocomplete result.
- **Variant Title Display**: When displaying product information, check if variant title is "Default Title" before showing it to users. This prevents confusing display text like "Product Name (Default Title)" and keeps the UI clean and professional.
