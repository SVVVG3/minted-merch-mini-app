### Recent Major Feature: Viral Sharing System ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Implementation Overview**: Created a comprehensive viral sharing system that allows users to share products and order confirmations directly in Farcaster feeds with rich embeds.

**Feature 1: Product Page Sharing** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Share Button**: Added share button to product page header next to cart button
- **Dynamic Meta Tags**: Implemented server-side metadata generation for each product page
- **Farcaster Frame Embeds**: Each product URL generates `fc:frame` meta tags with:
  - Dynamic product image via `/api/og/product?handle={handle}`
  - Product-specific call-to-action button: "🛒 Buy {Product} - ${price}"
  - Direct deep-link to product page in Mini App
- **Smart Sharing Logic**: 
  - ✅ **Farcaster Environment**: Opens Warpcast composer with pre-filled share text and URL
  - ✅ **Non-Farcaster Fallback**: Uses native Web Share API or clipboard copy
  - ✅ **Share Text**: "🛒 Check out this {product} for ${price} USDC! Shop crypto merch with instant payments on Base 🔵"

**Feature 2: Order Success Sharing** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Share Purchase Button**: Added prominent "Share My Purchase" button on order confirmation
- **Order Celebration**: Encourages users to share their successful crypto purchases
- **Dynamic OG Images**: Order-specific images via `/api/og/order?order={number}&total={amount}`
- **Viral Share Text**: "🎉 Just bought crypto merch with USDC! Order {number} for ${total} confirmed ✅ Instant payments on Base 🔵"

**Feature 3: Dynamic Open Graph Images** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Product Images**: `/api/og/product` route generates beautiful product cards with:
  - Product image, title, and price
  - Minted Merch branding
  - "Shop Now on Base" call-to-action
  - Professional dark theme with brand colors
- **Order Images**: `/api/og/order` route generates celebration images with:
  - Success checkmark and confirmation message
  - Order number and total amount
  - "Paid instantly on Base" messaging
  - Branded celebration design
- **Performance Optimized**: 5-minute cache headers for CDN optimization
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful error handling with branded fallback images

**Technical Architecture**:
- **Server-Side Metadata**: Product pages use `generateMetadata()` for dynamic `fc:frame` tags
- **Edge Runtime**: OG image generation uses Next.js Edge Runtime for performance
- **Component Separation**: Split product page into server/client components for metadata support
- **Cross-Platform Sharing**: Intelligent detection of Farcaster vs. web environment
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

**Viral Loop Implementation**:
1. **Discovery**: User sees shared product/order in Farcaster feed
2. **Engagement**: Rich embed with product image and clear CTA
3. **Conversion**: One-click to open Mini App and purchase
4. **Amplification**: User shares their own purchase, continuing the loop

### Recent UX Fixes

**Issue 1: Google Maps Clearing First/Last Name** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Root Cause**: When Google Maps autocomplete selected a place, the `populateAddressFromPlace` function was creating a completely new shipping object, overwriting firstName and lastName fields
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - ✅ **Preserve User Data**: Modified `populateAddressFromPlace` to preserve existing firstName, lastName, phone, and email when updating address
  - ✅ **Smart Address Update**: Only update address-related fields (address1, city, province, zip, country) from Google Maps
  - ✅ **Clear Address2**: Reset address2 field when using autocomplete for cleaner addresses
  - ✅ **React Closure Fix**: Used functional update pattern `setShipping(currentShipping => ...)` to prevent stale state closure issues
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Users can now fill in their name first, then use address autocomplete without losing their personal information

**Issue 2: "(Default Title)" Display in Product Names** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Root Cause**: Cart items store both product title and variant title, and when variant title was "Default Title", it was being displayed as "Product Name (Default Title)"
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - ✅ **Order History**: Updated OrderHistory component to only show variant title if it's not "Default Title"
  - ✅ **Checkout Flow**: Updated all three instances in CheckoutFlow component (shipping, shipping-method, and payment steps) to hide "Default Title" variants
  - ✅ **Consistent Logic**: Applied consistent filtering logic: `item.variant?.title && item.variant.title !== 'Default Title' && \`(${item.variant.title})\``
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Product names now display cleanly without unnecessary "(Default Title)" text

### Recent API Migration

**Issue: Google Places API Deprecation Warning** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Root Cause**: Google deprecated `google.maps.places.Autocomplete` as of March 1st, 2025
- **Warning Message**: "As of March 1st, 2025, google.maps.places.Autocomplete is not available to new customers. Please use google.maps.places.PlaceAutocompleteElement instead."
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - ✅ **Complete Migration**: Updated from deprecated `Autocomplete` to new `PlaceAutocompleteElement`
  - ✅ **API Import**: Changed to use `await google.maps.importLibrary('places')` for dynamic loading
  - ✅ **Event Handling**: Updated from `place_changed` event to `gmp-select` event listener
  - ✅ **Place Object**: Updated to use `event.placePrediction.toPlace()` and `place.fetchFields()`
  - ✅ **Address Components**: Updated field names from `long_name/short_name` to `longText/shortText`
  - ✅ **Country Restrictions**: Changed from `setComponentRestrictions()` to `includedRegionCodes` property
  - ✅ **UI Integration**: Replaced input element binding with container-based embedding
  - ✅ **CSS Styling**: Added CSS custom properties for styling the new element
  - ✅ **Fallback Support**: Maintained fallback input when Google Maps API is not available
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - No more deprecation warnings, future-proofed implementation

## Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- `window.confirm()` and `alert()` don't work reliably in Farcaster Mini App environments - use custom React modals instead
- Clear Cart functionality required custom confirmation modal to work in production Mini App context
- localStorage operations should have error handling for restricted embedded environments
- **Wagmi Connector Issues**: The `"getChainId is not a function"` error is a known Wagmi timing issue that requires waiting for connections to be ready before executing transactions
- **CRITICAL: Wagmi Hook Properties**: ⚠️ **NEVER use spread operator with USDC_CONTRACT in Wagmi hooks!** Both `useReadContract` and `writeContract` MUST use explicit `address: USDC_CONTRACT.address, abi: USDC_CONTRACT.abi` properties. Using `...USDC_CONTRACT` causes connector initialization errors.
- **Shopify API Debugging**: Enhanced logging is crucial for diagnosing order creation issues - always log request variables and response data
- **API Version Consistency**: Keep all Shopify API endpoints on the same version to avoid compatibility issues
- **Google Maps API Migration**: Google is actively deprecating older APIs. The `google.maps.places.Autocomplete` was deprecated March 1st, 2025. Always migrate to newer APIs (`PlaceAutocompleteElement`) to avoid console warnings and ensure continued functionality. The new API uses different event names (`gmp-select` vs `place_changed`), data structures (`longText/shortText` vs `long_name/short_name`), and integration methods (container-based vs input-based).
- **Google Maps Form Preservation**: When implementing address autocomplete, always preserve existing user input (firstName, lastName, phone, email) by using spread operator with existing state rather than creating a completely new object. Only update address-related fields from the autocomplete result.
- **Variant Title Display**: When displaying product information, check if variant title is "Default Title" before showing it to users. This prevents confusing display text like "Product Name (Default Title)" and keeps the UI clean and professional.
- **React State Closures**: When using state in event listeners (like Google Maps callbacks), use functional updates `setState(current => ...)` instead of direct state access to prevent stale closure issues.
- **Farcaster Sharing Implementation**: For viral sharing in Farcaster Mini Apps, implement both Farcaster-specific sharing (Warpcast composer) and web fallbacks (Web Share API, clipboard). Use `fc:frame` meta tags with dynamic images for rich social embeds.
- **Dynamic OG Images**: Use Next.js ImageResponse with Edge Runtime for dynamic Open Graph images. Always include proper cache headers (`max-age=300`) and fallback error handling to prevent gray images in social feeds.
- **Server-Side Metadata**: For dynamic meta tags in Next.js App Router, separate server components (for metadata) from client components (for interactivity). Use `generateMetadata()` function for dynamic `fc:frame` tags.
- **CRITICAL: Farcaster Mini App Sharing**: ⚠️ **NEVER use external URLs like `window.open(warpcastUrl)` for sharing within Farcaster Mini Apps!** This tries to open another app within the Mini App context. Instead, use the proper Farcaster SDK method `sdk.actions.composeCast({ text, embeds })` which will minimize the Mini App and open the native Farcaster composer. React hooks like `useFarcaster()` must be called at the component level, not inside event handlers.
- **CRITICAL: Mini App Embed Format**: ⚠️ **Mini App embeds use a completely different format than old Farcaster frames!** For Mini Apps, use a single JSON object in the `fc:frame` meta tag: `<meta name="fc:frame" content="<stringified FrameEmbed JSON>" />` with format `{version: "next", imageUrl: "...", button: {title: "...", action: {type: "launch_frame", url: "...", name: "...", splashImageUrl: "...", splashBackgroundColor: "..."}}}`. Do NOT use individual meta tags like `fc:frame:image`, `fc:frame:button:1`, etc. - those are for old frames, not Mini Apps.
