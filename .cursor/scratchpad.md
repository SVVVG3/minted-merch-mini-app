# Farcaster Shopify Mini App - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Building a Farcaster Mini App for https://mintedmerch.shop/ that allows users to shop directly inside Farcaster and pay using USDC via direct onchain wallet transfers. Using https://github.com/jc4p/shopify-mini-app-frame as the base template.

**Goal**: Complete MVP that enables:
- Product browsing inside Farcaster ‚úÖ
- Cart functionality ‚úÖ
- USDC payment flow ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **DEBUGGING IN PROGRESS**
- Shopify order creation ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **DEBUGGING IN PROGRESS**

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Environment Setup**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Shopify API credentials configured and working
- **Farcaster Integration**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Mini App context and authentication working
- **Payment Flow**: üîß **DEBUGGING** - Fixed Wagmi connector issues, testing payment flow
- **E-Commerce Checkout**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - 3-step checkout with shipping/tax calculation working
- **Order Management**: üîß **DEBUGGING** - Fixed domain configuration, enhanced error handling

### Current Issues Being Resolved

**Issue 1: Order Creation 500 Error** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- **Root Cause**: Shopify Admin API `orderCreate` mutation not supported in 2024-07 API version
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - ‚úÖ Updated API version from 2024-07 to 2024-10 (orderCreate supported)
  - ‚úÖ Fixed mutation input type from `OrderInput!` to `OrderCreateOrderInput!`
  - ‚úÖ Updated GraphQL query fields to use `displayFulfillmentStatus` and `displayFinancialStatus`
  - ‚úÖ Fixed input structure to use `priceSet` with `shopMoney` instead of deprecated price fields
  - ‚úÖ Fixed transaction structure to use `amountSet` instead of deprecated amount/currency fields
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling with null checks for order object
  - ‚úÖ Added detailed logging for Shopify API requests/responses

**Issue 2: Payment Connector Error** ‚úÖ **FIXED** 
- **Root Cause**: `"r.connector.getChainId is not a function"` - Incorrect Wagmi v2 hook usage
- **Solution Applied**:
  - ‚úÖ **FINAL FIX**: Removed invalid `config` parameter from Wagmi hooks
  - ‚úÖ Wagmi v2 hooks automatically use config from WagmiProvider context
  - ‚úÖ Eliminated config divergence that was causing connector errors
  - ‚úÖ Simplified to follow exact Farcaster Mini App documentation pattern
  - ‚úÖ Removed unnecessary `useConnections` complexity

### Technical Approach for Current Debugging:

**Order Creation Debugging:**
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to see exact Shopify API requests and responses
- **Error Handling**: Added null checks and better error messages
- **API Consistency**: Unified API versions across all Shopify integrations

**Payment Flow Debugging:**
- **Connector Validation**: Check connector availability before payment execution
- **Connection Readiness**: Wait for Wagmi connections to be ready
- **Error Prevention**: Prevent "getChainId is not a function" error with proper timing

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**üîß Critical Issues Addressed**

**Issue 1 - Order Creation 500 Error**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- **Problem**: `"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')"` 
- **Root Cause**: Shopify Admin API returning null order object
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling, logging, and null checks
- **Status**: Enhanced logging deployed to production for diagnosis

**Issue 2 - Payment Connector Error**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**  
- **Problem**: `"r.connector.getChainId is not a function"`
- **Root Cause**: Known Wagmi issue with connector initialization timing
- **Solution**: Added connector validation and connections readiness checks
- **Status**: Wagmi timing fixes deployed to production

**Current Status**:

- ‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: All required tokens present in production
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Enhanced logging and validation added
- ‚úÖ **Code Deployed**: Both fixes pushed to production

**Expected Result**: 
The complete checkout flow should now work:

2. **Order Creation** ‚úÖ - Should create orders with detailed logging
3. **Order Confirmation** ‚úÖ - Should display order details
4. **Enhanced Debugging** ‚úÖ - Detailed logs for any remaining issues

**Next Action**: User should test the complete purchase flow and share any new logs or errors.

## Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- `window.confirm()` and `alert()` don't work reliably in Farcaster Mini App environments - use custom React modals instead
- Clear Cart functionality required custom confirmation modal to work in production Mini App context
- localStorage operations should have error handling for restricted embedded environments
- **Wagmi Connector Issues**: The `"getChainId is not a function"` error is a known Wagmi timing issue that requires waiting for connections to be ready before executing transactions
- **Shopify API Debugging**: Enhanced logging is crucial for diagnosing order creation issues - always log request variables and response data
- **API Version Consistency**: Keep all Shopify API endpoints on the same version to avoid compatibility issues

## Next Steps

1. **Test Complete Checkout Flow**: User should test the full purchase process
2. **Monitor Enhanced Logs**: Check the detailed logging for any remaining issues  
3. **Verify Order Creation**: Confirm orders are created successfully in Shopify
4. **Final MVP Testing**: Complete end-to-end testing for production readiness
