## üõ† **What You Need to Do**

### **1. Run Database Migration**
Execute the migration to add the free shipping column:
```sql
-- Apply the migration
\i database/migrations/add_free_shipping_to_discounts.sql
```

### **2. Test with Sample Data**
Create a test discount code with free shipping:
```sql
-- Create test discount
\i database/test_free_shipping_discount.sql
```

### **3. Test the Functionality**
1. **Apply Test Code**: Use code `FREESHIP20` in cart
2. **Verify Display**: Check that "FREE SHIPPING" badge appears
3. **Check Checkout**: Ensure shipping shows as "FREE" in checkout flow
4. **Complete Order**: Verify orders process correctly with $0 shipping

### **4. Create Production Discount Codes**
Example for a 100% free giveaway:
```sql
INSERT INTO discount_codes (
  code, discount_type, discount_value, free_shipping,
  is_shared_code, max_uses_total, max_uses_per_user,
  discount_scope, discount_description
) VALUES (
  'GIVEAWAY100', 'percentage', 100, TRUE,
  TRUE, 10, 1,
  'site_wide', '100% free product with free shipping giveaway'
);
```

### **Scenario 3: 100% Free with Shipping**
- Create 100% discount with free shipping
- Apply to cart with products
- Verify $0 total including shipping
- Confirm shipping information still collected

### **Scenario 4: Product-Specific Free Shipping**

## üîÑ **Workflow**

### **For Giveaways & Raffles**
1. **Create Discount**: Set 100% discount + free shipping
2. **Set Limits**: Configure max uses (total and per user)
3. **Share Code**: Distribute to winners
4. **Collect Info**: System still collects full shipping details
5. **Process Orders**: Orders created normally with $0 total

### **For Promotions**
1. **Create Discount**: Set percentage discount + free shipping
2. **Configure Scope**: Site-wide or product-specific
3. **Set Expiration**: Optional time limit
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track via debug endpoints

## üö® **Important Notes**

### **Backward Compatibility**
- All existing discount codes continue to work unchanged
- Default `free_shipping = FALSE` for existing codes

- Only the shipping cost is set to $0

### **Performance**
- New database index on `free_shipping` column for efficient queries
- No impact on existing discount validation performance
- Minimal overhead for free shipping checks

### **Security**
- Free shipping follows same usage tracking as discounts
- Prevents abuse through per-user and total usage limits
- Full audit trail maintained

---

## üìä **Monitoring & Analytics**

### **Track Free Shipping Usage**
```sql
-- Count free shipping discount usage
SELECT 
  dc.code,
  dc.discount_description,
  COUNT(dcu.id) as uses,
  SUM(dcu.discount_amount) as total_product_savings
FROM discount_codes dc
LEFT JOIN discount_code_usage dcu ON dc.id = dcu.discount_code_id
WHERE dc.free_shipping = TRUE
GROUP BY dc.id, dc.code, dc.discount_description
ORDER BY uses DESC;
```

### **Debug Endpoints**
- Use existing `/api/debug/discount-usage-analysis` endpoint
- Monitor free shipping discount effectiveness
- Track usage patterns and abuse prevention
